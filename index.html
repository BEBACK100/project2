                Durga's victory over Mahishasur. It is particularly popular and traditionally celebrated in the

                states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Tripura, Assam and the country of Bangladesh. The

            <h1>You can enjoy this Festival</h1>
            <p>Durga puja is an old tradition of Hinduism,[21] though its exact origins are unclear. Surviving
                manuscripts from the 14th—century provide guidelines for Durga puja, while historical records suggest
                that royalty and wealthy families were sponsoring major Durga puja festivities since at least the
                16th-century.[22][self-published source?][9] The prominence of Durga puja increased during the British
                Raj in the provinces of Bengal, Odisha and Assam.[23][2] However, in modern times, the importance of
                Durga puja is more as a social and cultural festival than a religious one, wherever it is observed.

                Over the years, Durga puja has morphed into an inseparable part of Indian culture with a diverse group
                of people celebrating this festival in their unique way while on tradition.[2]</p>

                        the shape-shifting asura, Mahishasura.[13][14][A] Thus, the festival epitomizes the victory of
                        good over evil, though it is also in part a harvest festival celebrating the goddess as the
                        motherly power behind all of life and creation.[16][17] Durga puja coincides with Navaratri and
                        Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism,[18] in which the Ram Lila
                        dance-drama is enacted, celebrating the victory of Rama against Ravana, and effigies of Ravana
